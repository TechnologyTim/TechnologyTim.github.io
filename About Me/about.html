    <h1>Some stuff about me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello :) My name is Tim and this is my awesome website! As told on the Home page too, I am a 18 years old student,
      that is interested in Coding, computer stuff and technology in general. <br>
      Thanks for visiting this site, I actually wrote it all by myself, just for fun :) <br>
      I usually code in C/C++ and Java and also sometimes in C# and Rust and obviously in HTML, CSS (and JavaScript).<br>
      As my main text editor I use Sublime Text and Visual Studio for C / C++ projects. <br>

      As my OS I sadly use Windows. I was a Linux user for a long time, but had to go back to Windows because of programs I needed to use. I HATE Windows 11, Windows 7 was just the best!

      Apart from technology, I really love books and history. I just want to learn so much about past events and what we can learn from them. And books are a great resource and its just very fun to read :).

      More info coming soon (maybe) ...
