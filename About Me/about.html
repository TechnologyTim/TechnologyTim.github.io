    <h1>Some stuff about me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello :) My name is Tim and this is my awesome website! As told on the Home page too, I am a 18 years old student,
      that is interested in Coding, computer stuff and technology in general. I am studying to be a history and English teacher in Germany.<br>
      Thanks for visiting this site, I actually wrote it all by myself, just for fun :) <br>
      I usually code in C/C++ and Java and also sometimes in Rust and obviously in HTML and CSS (I am to scared of JS to touch it!).<br>
      As my main text editor I use Emacs and in the terminal neovim. I am also trying out the Kakoune editor just for fun. <br>

      As my main OS I currently use Fedora Atomic Budgie, customized with uBlue, and NixOS with Budgie. I ditched Windows years ago and I never looked back!<br>
      My home server currently runs RHEL (with a developer licence) because I just want that thing to run without me having to update it every week or so. 

      Apart from technology, I really love books and history. I just want to learn so much about past events and what we can learn from them. And books are a great resource and its just very fun to read :). <br>

      I also want to mention some of my political views, which basically are just that I really like communism and think it is a way better alternative to the toxic capitalism that our world has evolved to. 
      But I do not want to go into an anti-capitalist rant here ;) <br>

      More info coming soon (maybe) ...
