    <h1>Some stuff about me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello :) My name is Tim and this is my awesome website! As told on the Home page too, I am a 17 years old student,
      that is interested in Coding, Apple stuff and everything technology. <br>
      Thanks for visiting this site, I actually wrote it all by myself, just for fun :) <br>
      I usually code in C/C++ and Java and also sometimes in C# and obviously in HTML, CSS (and JavaScript). I also use Xcode and Swift often to create apps for Apple devices.<br>
      As my main text editor I use BBEdit for smaller edits and occasionally VSCode for bigger projects, though I usually use Xcode or an IDE so I need them rarely. <br>

      The first version of macOS / OS X I ever used was OS X Snow Leopard. Then I jumped to El Capitan, which I used for the longest time. Then I switched to Mojave (yes, I skipped Sierra and High Sierra), then Catalina, Big Sur and now Monterey (Which I dislike with a passion). Although, my favourite version is still OS X El Capitan, just because of nostalgia (and because I prefer the older design of OS X). My first Mac was the early 2009 24" iMac.

      More info coming soon (maybe) ...
