    <h1>Some stuff about me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello :) My name is Tim and this is my awesome website! As told on the Home page too, I am a 18 years old student,
      that is interested in Coding, computer stuff and technology in general. <br>
      Thanks for visiting this site, I actually wrote it all by myself, just for fun :) <br>
      I usually code in C/C++ and Java and also sometimes in C# and obviously in HTML, CSS (although never in JS ;)).<br>
      As my main text editor I use Emacs and in the terminal neovim. <br>

      As my main OS I use Debian (and sometimes Ubuntu) Linux with XFCE (desktop) and KDE Plasma (laptop). I ditched Windows years ago and I never looked back!<br>
      My home server currently runs RHEL (with a developer licence) because I just want that thing to run without me having to update it every week or so. 

      Apart from technology, I really love books and history. I just want to learn so much about past events and what we can learn from them. And books are a great resource and its just very fun to read :). <br>

      I also want to mention some of my political views, which basically are just that I really like communism and think it is a way better alternative to the toxic capitalism that our world has evolved to. But I do not want to go into an anti-capitalist rant here ;) <br>

      More info coming soon (maybe) ...
