    <h1>Some stuff about me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello :) My name is Tim and this is my awesome website! As told on the Home page too, I am a 17 years old student,
      that is interested in Coding, Apple stuff and everything technology. <br>
      Thanks for visiting this site, I actually wrote it all by myself, just for fun :) <br>
      I usually code in C/C++ and Java and also sometimes in C# and obviously in HTML, CSS (and JavaScript).<br>
      As my main text editor I use Emacs and sometimes VIM for smaller edits. <br>

      My favourite OS is Linux and BSD. I use Void Linux and Open / Free BSD. My preferred window manager is the kind of abscure ratpoison wm on Linux or a fork of it named sdorfehs wm by jcs on OpenBSD:)

      More info coming soon (maybe) ...
