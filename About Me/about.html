    <h1>Some stuff about me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello :) My name is Tim and this is my awesome website! As told on the Home page too, I am a 16 years old student,
      that is interested in Coding, open source, Linux and everything technology.
      Thanks for visiting this site, I actually wrote it all by myself, just for fun :)
      I usually code in C/C++ and Java and also sometimes in C# and obviously in HTML, CSS (and JavaScript). My favourite language is C, just because it is very simple and fast.

      More info coming soon (maybe) ...
